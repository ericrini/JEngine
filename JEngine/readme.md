- Need to add Vector and Matrix constructors.
- Need to add collision detection routine to ActorManager.
- Definition of event arguments for Actor init, update, render, collide, etc.
- Add a z-index to the Actor.
- Need to add unit tests for Actor.
- Pretty much everything needs javadoc. I think its ok to delay this.
